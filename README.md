This code defines a simple FastAPI web application that serves both static files and a REST API to check word ambiguity using the nltk library. The core functionality uses WordNet from NLTK to determine if a word has multiple meanings, which indicates ambiguity.

Imports :

1. FastAPI and StaticFiles from fastapi: Used to create the FastAPI app and serve static files (like HTML, CSS, JS).

2. BaseModel from pydantic: Defines the data model (schema) for the incoming request in the API.

3. nltk and wordnet: Used to access the WordNet corpus, which contains information about word meanings and synonyms.

4. HTMLResponse: Used to send HTML content as a response to the user.

Steps:


1.Install FastAPI and Uvicorn: First, you need to install FastAPI (the web framework) and Uvicorn (the ASGI server)


2.Create the FastAPI Backend: Weâ€™ll set up a FastAPI server that accepts a word as input, runs the ambiguity checker code, and returns the result as a response in JSON format.

3.Create the Frontend (HTML + CSS + JS): Now, create a static folder for the frontend resources (HTML, CSS, JS), which will interact with the FastAPI backend.

4.Update FastAPI to Serve Static Files: To serve the index.html file and other static files (like CSS or JS), you need to configure FastAPI to handle static files.

5.Run the FastAPI Server: Run the FastAPI server with Uvicorn: uvicorn main:app --reload
